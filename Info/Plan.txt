I currently have no plans or thoughts about the front-end.

About the back-end, I'll build some data structures.

1) A set that will be used for the "taking random letters or each round" bit.

2) A set that can store strings and allow for searching. Probably a trie.

3) Something that can store player values, such as scores.

4) ???

5) Profit.
